CI/CD is the set of combined practices used in software development. CI means that multiple peoples' work should be merged frequently in one place (VCS for example). CD stands for deploying multiple releases frequently.  

In contrast to the conventional approach to deploying, where at each iteration a big project is created which makes user to perform a set of Developer Operations before he can actually use a release (Install dependencies, include them in CMakeLists for example, if we are using CMake with C++ etc.). CD aims at building, testing and releasing the software with a greater speed.
